## 🏆 Featured Project

### 🏎️ [OpenF1-Transcribe](https://github.com/palomacdev/openf1-transcribe)
*An AI-powered microservice to transcribe and index Formula 1 team radios.*

I built a complete pipeline to ingest audio from the OpenF1 API, transcribe it using **OpenAI Whisper**, and make it searchable via a **FastAPI** backend.

* **Architecture:** Dockerized Microservice Architecture.
* **Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor), OpenAI Whisper, Docker Compose.
* **Key Challenge:** Implementing asynchronous batch processing to handle thousands of audio files without blocking the API.
